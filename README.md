# Uncivilized-Expansion
Another minor side project which may or may not be a small step towards a greater enhancement mod for Unciv - this one adds more buildings and wonders (importing several of them from Civ 5/6 scenarios or other Civ games) and augments select civs from other mods. Also very much a WIP. May add new unique buildings for main game + BNW civs at a later date.

Must have the BNW mod or another mod that adds the Cocoa resource which is absent from base game enabled.
